            The Undo and Redo icons in the Devaito Editor make it easy to reverse or restore changes you've made on your site.
            Whether it’s adjusting the color of a button or editing your text content, these tools allow you to navigate changes
            effortlessly.

        <h2 class="h2">Using the Undo Feature</h2>
        <p class="parag">
            The Undo feature lets you reverse any changes you've made within the editor. For instance, if you modify an
            element's design but later decide to go back to a previous setting, the Undo function allows you to do this without
            manually resetting it.
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
            To undo a change, simply click the Undo icon at the bottom left of your editor.

            The Redo feature allows you to restore any changes you’ve undone. This can be helpful if you've mistakenly undone a
            change or decide you want to keep the original modification after all.

            To redo an action, click the Redo icon at the bottom left of your editor.
